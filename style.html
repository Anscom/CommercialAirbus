                <hr>
                <p><big>Airbus</big> is a European multinational aerospace corporation. The 'SE' in the name means it is a societas Europaea, which enables it to be registered as European rather than Dutch. 
                    As of 2019, Airbus is the world's largest airliner manufacturer and took the most airliner orders. Airbus is registered in the Netherlands; its shares are traded in France, Germany and Spain. 
                    It designs, manufactures and sells civil and military aerospace products worldwide and manufactures aircraft in the European Union and various other countries. The company has three divisions: Commercial Aircraft (Airbus S.A.S.), Defence and Space, and Helicopters, the third being the largest in its industry in terms of revenues and turbine helicopter deliveries.</p>
                
                <p>Airbus is an international reference in the aerospace sector. We design, manufacture and deliver industry-leading commercial aircraft, helicopters, military transports, satellites and launch vehicles, as well as providing data services, navigation, secure communications, urban mobility and other solutions for customers on a global scale.

                    With a forward-looking strategy based on cutting-edge technologies, digital and scientific excellence, we aim for a better-connected, safer and more prosperous world.</p>

                   <div class="text-col">
                    <p>A220 Family aircraft have been specifically designed for the 100-150 seat market, resulting in efficiencies inherent in purpose-built aircraft, and an unmatched environmental scorecard. What’s more, the A220-100 and A220-300 have over 99% parts commonality, as well as the same pilot type rating, facilitating the family’s addition to any airline’s fleet.</p>
                    <p>A220 Family jetliners were designed using state-of-the-art computational aerodynamics combined with 21st century supercomputing capability; the result is a family of aircraft with optimal aerodynamic performance and efficiency. Powering the aircraft are twin Pratt & Whitney PurePower PW1500G geared turbofan engines specifically designed for the A220. With a bypass ratio of 12:1 – one of the highest of any turbofan engine in the world – the aircraft features 25% lower fuel burn per seat than previous generation aircraft, half the noise footprint, and decreased emissions.</p>
                    <p>Together, the A220 Family represents the most efficient aircraft in the skies in their class, with low operating costs and low noise levels. This makes the A220 Family aircraft ideal for urban operations and noise-sensitive airports.</p>

                    <div class="text-col">
                        <p>The A320 is one aircraft in four sizes (A318, A319, A320 and A321), representing the most successful and versatile jetliner family ever. Seating from 100 to 240 passengers and flying throughout the world, with the widest single-aisle cabin, an A320 takes off or lands every 1.6 seconds. From the heat of the desert to icy Antarctic runways, or from short runway urban environments to remote high-altitude airports, the A320 can take passengers anywhere.</p>
                    <p>As the longest-range single-aisle aircraft, airlines and passengers alike have benefitted from the A320’s exceptional efficiency and quality since its introduction, which has opened up exciting new travel possibilities throughout the world. Now with new engine options (NEO) available, the A320 Family continues to be the preferred choice for passengers and customers; setting the standard for the single-aisle market and securing its status as the world’s best-selling aircraft of all time</p>
                    <p>This is an aircraft that you can rely on. This is the aircraft that changed the game.</p>

                        <p>The A330neo is a true example of a highly-innovative aircraft that delivers superior quality and efficiency. As a member of Airbus’ family of wide-body jetliners, the A330neo benefits from continuous investment of over 150 million euro every year – integrating the latest developments from the A350 XWB and A380 Families to maintain its position as the best in its class, well ahead of its competition.</p>
                        <p>The A330neo is powered by high-bypass ratio, new generation engines and designed with an advanced high-span wing vastly improving the aerodynamics. New materials have also been used across the wing including titanium pylon and composite nacelle. All these features combined, ensures that the A330neo has the lowest seat-mile cost of any mid-size wide-body and burns 25% less fuel burn than the previous generation competitors.</p>

                        <p>The most perfect designs often are found in nature. That’s why Airbus looks to learn from the natural world when designing and improving upon its aircraft. As the newest member of the company’s wide-body family, the A350 XWB is an example of how this inspirational blend of science and nature represents another significant evolution in the ongoing mission to conceive and manufacture the perfect aircraft.</p>
                        <p>The A350 XWB has learned from nature to help ensure a healthy future for the planet, whether it’s the revolutionary adaptive wing design – inspired by birds – which morphs while airborne to achieve maximum aerodynamic efficiency by optimising wing loading, reducing drag and lowering fuel burn; or the savings generated by innovative technological advances.</p>
                        <p>Designed with passengers and airlines at heart, the A350 XWB benefits from being built with over 70% advanced materials; combining carbon composites (53%), titanium and modern aluminium alloys, to create a lighter and more cost-efficient aircraft while also reducing maintenance requirements. The latest-generation Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines are quieter and more efficient.</p>
                        <p>The combination of these advantages result in 25% lower operating costs, fuel burn and CO2 emissions when compared with previous-generation aircraft – showing Airbus’ commitment to protecting the environment while remaining at the cutting edge of air travel. </p>
